    <h3>The problem we're solving</h3>
    <p>
      Globally over 10 million tonnes of food is wasted per year. That’s the
      weight of 190 Titanics!
    </p>
    <p>
      We use farmland the size of China, Mongolia and Kazakhstan combined to
      grow food that is never actually eaten. Meanwhile 1 in 7 people worldwide
      experience food poverty.
    </p>
    <br></br>
    <p>
      We're all confronted with issues everyday, and some are easier to ignore
      than others. Nobody likes seeing food go to waste, but the reality is that
      it's very common for businesses and households to waste food.
    </p>
    <br></br>
    <p>
      We believe that small actions can lead to big change. We created Fridger
      app that helps to combat the issue of waste by providing simple tracking
      of products in your fridge and suggests visual, easy to follow recipes to
      use the products before they expire.
